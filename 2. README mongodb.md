## How I linked my scraper with mongodb.
	1. first I installed mongodb on my virtual machine
	2. Afterwards, I made sure my script was connected to the mongodb (localmachine) server.
	3. Through my python script I connected to the mongodb database 'admin' and then I created a collection called 'bitcoin'.
	3. Finally I output the highest value to a json document and then I added this to my mongodb server every minute.
